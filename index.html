    <h1>Tea Stall</h1>
    <p>
        Tea is a popular hot drink all over the world. Bangladesh is home to tea. The people of Bangladesh are very fond of taking tea. So, a tea stall is commonplace for all classes of people in any corner of our country. A tea stall is a small shop where tea is prepared and served to the customers. Biscuits, bread, bananas, betel leaf are also available here. It opens early in the morning and closes late at night. It is usually found near any educational institutions, banks, factories, mills, industries, at the turn of the road, in the train station, or steamer ghats. It is not well-furnished. Even in some stalls, there are no chairs but benches.

        A tea stall has normally two parts. In the front part, there are chairs, tables, and show-cases. On the other part, there is the kitchen. A boy is employed in a tea stall. Sometimes, the owner himself serves as the boy and the cashier. A stall can be termed as the mini Sangsad of the villagers. Different kinds of people gather here. They refresh themselves with a cup of tea and discuss politics and different social affairs. Thus a tea stall is a noisy, chaotic, crowded, dirty, and busy place.
